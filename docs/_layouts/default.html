            How can you detect fake golf grips?
          </h3>
          <p>
            eBay buyers have reported fake golf grips smell like gasoline due to cheap rubber.
            It's also likely fake grips are more difficult to slide on to golf club shafts.
            When compared to an authentic grip, you'll notice major differences in quality.

          <p>
            We review feedback for eBay sellers. If there is any feedback from a buyer about fake grips, the seller gets added to this list.
            We save data about the seller to track any new accounts the seller might create.

            Golf Pride suggests price is the determining factor.
            If the grips you purchased are significantly discounted, chances
            are the grips are counterfeit.

          <strong>Why?</strong> There are way too many sellers on eBay selling fake golf grips.
          Even worse, many buyers are unaware the grips are fake.

        <li>
          <strong>How?</strong> Data is manually managed by us. We look at eBay seller feedback.
          If a buyer complains about grips being fake, the seller is added to our list.
