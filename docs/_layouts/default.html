            Are Golf Pride grips on eBay fake?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Most of the time, yes. However, there are some reputable sellers on eBay. If the price
            sounds too good to be true, it is. For example, Golf Pride's most expensive offering is
            over $10 per grip. If you see 13 grips for $60, those grips are fake.

            How can you detect fake golf grips?
          </h3>
          <p>
            eBay buyers have reported fake golf grips smell like gasoline due to cheap rubber.
            It's also likely fake grips are more difficult to slide on to golf club shafts.
            When compared to an authentic grip, you'll notice major differences in quality.

            How does a seller get put on this list?

            We review feedback for eBay sellers. If there is any feedback from a buyer about fake grips, the seller gets added to this list.
            We save data about the seller to track any new accounts the seller might create.

            What can I do if I suspect the grips I purchased are fake?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Golf Pride suggests price is the determining factor.
            If the grips you purchased are significantly discounted, chances
            are the grips are counterfeit.
