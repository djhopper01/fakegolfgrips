            How can you detect fake golf grips?
          </h3>
          <p>
            eBay buyers have reported fake golf grips smell like gasoline due to cheap rubber.
            It's also likely fake grips are more difficult to slide on to golf club shafts.
            When compared to an authentic grip, you'll notice major differences in quality.

            What can I do if I suspect the grips I purchased are fake?

            Golf Pride suggests price is the determining factor.
            If the grips you purchased are significantly discounted, chances
            are the grips are counterfeit.
